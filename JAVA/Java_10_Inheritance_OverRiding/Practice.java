/* ------- A real example of Java Method Overriding --------
   Consider a scenario where Bank is a class that provides functionality to get the rate of interest.
   However, the rate of interest varies according to banks. For example, SBI, ICICI and AXIS banks
   could provide 8%, 7%, and 9% rate of interest.
